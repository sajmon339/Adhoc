Grain of data 
should this be split in different streams - slow/fast moving data
where does the data is coming from 
GDPR?
Customer data retention 
is there any customer PII data stored/processed 
PII data storage or customer/client data storage vs local laws
what if port gets changed after data is already registered produced ?
does main and mode link ? is there a fk ?
why different tables for ocean/freight 
what stores them in Data lake ?
what is the structure ? - parquet ? files ? can you use lambda ?
Kimbal Immon 
star vs snoflake 
reporting vs analitics tool ?
how data in dwh will be accessed ?
    user queries ?
future proof - avoid tables/column names which are specific to given process (for metadata use key value pair table structures)
partitioning for writes - should be at the grain of BK ?
